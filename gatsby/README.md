# Balthazaurus Gatsby & Sanity Starter

Run "npm start" to develop
Run "npm build" to build to public directory

Once you have Sanity up and running, copy the project ID to the gatsby .env

# Sanity schema changes
You will need to deploy the graphql api before you can see schema changes. 
Also you need to restart the application when this happens.
